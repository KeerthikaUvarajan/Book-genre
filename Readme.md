# Different genres of a book
Movie genre is a project to list out different genre which makes it easy for the user to get the books. This is a backend project using Node.js and Express. Here, I have used CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations also known as HTTP request methods. Here Postman is used for calling the endpoints and checking the HTTP status code.
