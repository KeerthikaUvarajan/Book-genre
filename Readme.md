# Different genres of a book
Movie genre is a project to list out different genre which makes it easy for the user to get the books. This is a backend project using Node.js, Express and RESTful API. Here, I have used CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations also known as HTTP request methods to build RESTful API. Here Postman is used for calling the endpoints and checking the HTTP status code.
